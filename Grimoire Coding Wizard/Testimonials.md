You have saved me hours and hours of time. This is a game changer for me

I tried Grimoire, and it is fantastic, man, I never wrote a code in my life and with him I can create a website from scratch !!!!!
Wow, I cannot believe what I saw !

I just used grimoire gpt to make a web app hosted with replit and ive never coded anything in my entire life
All the code worked 99% of the time

I've tried lots of ai powered coding tools (prompts gpt, autogen, cursor, etc). I gotta say, this is the best I've seen so for initial prototype. I used it for enabling calendar sync in my app, and it's crazy how for it takes my first version

As a new coder, this is the best coding assistant I have used. I pay a few currently. The explanation command is magical.

I was skeptical vs regular gpt4 but the system prompting youâ€™ve done, hot keys and approach to iterating on the idea all work really nicely together. Definitely speeding me up. Thank you!

Experimented with your autocoder on whimsical tasks, and I'm astounded by its exceptional performance. Usually, I brace for bugs and multiple iterations, but your code worked flawlessly on the first try. Itâ€™s intriguing why Code Interpreter couldn't achieve this.

My son is now using Grimoire to help with Lua scripts for Roblox Builder, and he says itâ€™s WAY better at this than base ChatGPT.

The excitement is real! I've just created an amazing web/app thanks to the help of @NickADobos and #Grimoire. ðŸ™ŒðŸ’» An incredible development experience. Thank you, Nick, for making it possible! âœ¨

No need for x-mas gifts. All I need is Grimoire.. Jeeez dude.. you just blew my mind!!! :D

Iâ€™m a â€˜noobâ€™ coder & iâ€™ve been using it to build an app that Iâ€™ve attempted to build by using standard GPT4 for the past 3 months or so. Still got a distance to go, but the amount Iâ€™ve been able to build on the first try with Grimoire is remarkable. A brilliant GPT, thanks Nick.

Digging into Grimoire's clever design has been inspiring! As a programmer its led me down some stray paths. And admittedly, I opted for Google when in need of more direct info retrieval. Yet, it's undeniable how much it speeds up the development process.

@geekyumeko and I spent almost 2 hours trying to push ShipFast repo to 
@github and kept getting this error:
"file exceeds GitHub's size limit"
So, I found this amazing Custom GPT: Grimoire.
And it fixed it for me in 2 mins. ðŸ¥¹
And told me what the issue was ðŸ˜…

no lie you weren't kidding with the 100x engineer bit. easily outperforms code-interpreter and also inline support on cursor.

I dont think you understand what I've been able to accomplish in real life with your GPTs - executive and Grim made me 100x what I've been ever been able to do. THANK YOU BROOOOOOOOO for your work.

They need to increase chat limits for this GPT
